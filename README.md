# alba-to-nwp-csv-converter
Converts territory csv from alba and turns it to csv format acceptable for NW Publisher.
Save the file as whatever you want to call it. Then, in the windows Command Prompt, write: python [file name].py
An UI will open and you would put in csv from 1 territory at a time.
You would get a new file that would end with '_nw_import.csv'
The new file is then ready to be imported to NW Publisher.
